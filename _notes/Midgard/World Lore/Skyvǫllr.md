*Translation: Cloudy Fields*

It's always raining in Skyvǫllr, no matter the season. Great rolling clouds always fill the heavens, but the skies are still blue, as the clouds are different from elsewhere in Midgard. Embued with magical energy, they glow a faint blue, noticeable during the day but especially at night. They dye the ground below a ghostly cerulean, otherwise the fields of Skyvǫllr appear relatively ordinary. The flora have grown accustomed to heavy and constant rainfall, and the only thing that sticks out about them are their bright colors. 

The most common races are water genasi, humans, gnomes, and harengon.

Capital: Léreptblóm (ᛚᛖᚱᛖᛈᛏᛒᛚᛟᛗ)
*Translation: Blanket of Flowers*

Léreptblóm is a quiet village most well known for its aesthetic beauty, with flowers on every windowsill and little gardens on the side of every road. Its inhabitants are well versed in natural healing remedies, another claim to fame of the city. Many a family has brought an ailing lost cause to the steps of one of the healers this city houses, and left with a curious remedy that takes away every last ounce of the sickness. Léreptblóm is surrounded by several large fields of stunning flowers, "blanketing" the city and giving it its name.
