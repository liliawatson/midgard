Asgard is the home of the Aesir gods. It was constructed by the gods with the creation of the Nine Realms. It is set upon the splendid plains of Idavoll, a bounteous field where the Aesir meet to discuss important issues. 

> In the beginning, [[Odin]] established rulers, and bade them ordain fates with him, and give counsel concerning the planning of the town; that was in the place which is called Idavoll, in the midst of the town. It was their first work to make that court in which their twelve seats stand, and another, the high-seat which Allfather himself has. That house is the best-made of any on earth, and the greatest; without and within, it is all like one piece of gold; men call it Gladsheim.

Asgard is also protected by an insurmountable wall, which was constructed in [[The Building of Asgard's Wall]]. 

There are halls for most of the gods in Asgard. Bilskírnir is the hall of Thor, Fólkvangr is the hall of Freya, and [[Valhalla]] is the hall overseen by Odin that hosts slain warriors who died in glory, as well as the Valkyries. Odin's throne is called Hliðskjálf, from which he can see all Nine Realms.
