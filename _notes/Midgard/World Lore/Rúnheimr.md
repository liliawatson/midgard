*Translation: Land of Mysteries*

Dark, rolling clouds fill the skies, and frequent lightning storms have left many a skeleton tree standing among the towering forests of Rúnheimr. Dancing lights float over the mist covered ground, a thick whiteness that hides pits, caves, and deep lakes. The lights always stay just out of reach, and legend has it that they are the lost souls of fallen Ljósálfar that are trying to return to Alfheim. Like the rest of the Floating Continent, there's a deep magic in the earth of Rúnheimr, something ancient and elemental. 

The most common races are fire genasi, elves, firbolgs, and tieflings.

Capital: Hárrdys (ᚺᚨᚱᚱᛞᚤᛋ)
*Translation: Odin's Grave*

Fabled to become Odin's final resting place after Ragnarok, the heart of Hárrdys is an ancient statue of Yggdrasil, with Odin swinging from its branches. Its inhabitants have created long metal poles placed high above their structures to draw the lightning down and use its energy for magical purposes. There are roads leading outwards to other, smaller towns, but due to the dangerous mist that cloaks the nation, travel is rare here. Hárrdys is full of welcoming yet secretive people, not opposed to outsiders and quite hospitable, but fiercely protective of their culture and magical techniques.
