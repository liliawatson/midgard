*Translation: World's End*

If one journeys too far through Skyvǫllr, they will begin to see the flowers fade out and freeze over as the temperature drops. Travel further still, and they may never return. Endaknǫttr is beautiful, just like all the countries on the Floating Continent, but it is especially deadly. If the freezing weather doesn't kill you, stopping in a yuan-ti settlement is guaranteed to be your undoing. Their cities are heated with strong magic, which can draw in outsiders on the verge of hypothermia, but unless one is there to swear fealty to the yuan-ti, they have a strict tradition of sacrificing those who make the mistake of wandering in.

Endaknǫttr is almost solely populated by yuan-ti. Other races are rare here.

Capital: Gjallarjǫkull (ᚷᛃᚨᛚᛚᚨᚱᛃᛟᚴᚢᛚᛚ)
*Translation: The Frozen Death*

The cold is troublesome for the yuan-ti, as their snake blood doesn't take well to low temperatures, which is why magical heat warms the streets of the largest city in Endaknǫttr. Gjallarjǫkull was the first yuan-ti city built in the country after they took refuge there. The yuan-ti tried (and failed) to wrench power from the genasi a century ago during the Draconic War, and when they were defeated, rather than returning to the Wasteland they took shelter in what would become Gjallarjǫkull. Though it is widely considered to be better than the Wasteland, many yuan-ti openly despise having to live in Endaknǫttr, and those who manage to escape the city alive say that it seems they're gathering forces.
