The Bifrost is the rainbow bridge that connects [[Asgard]] and [[World Lore/Midgard]], and is guarded by [[Heimdall]]. Only gods can cross the bridge; mortals would be burned up.

When [[Ragnarok]] comes, the giants will breach Heimdallâ€™s defenses and cross the bridge to storm Asgard and slay the gods, shattering the Bifrost.
