The [[Eternal Ash Tree]]'s root in the Realm of the Gods is next to the Well of Urd in [[Asgard]]. This well is next to a hall, where three women called the Norns live, the personifications of time. Their names are [[Urðr]], [[Skuld]], and [[Verðandi]].

Each morning the Norns draw water from the well, and collect the moist earth or clay around it, and pour it over Yggdrasil. This is done to keep the world tree green and healthy. If they fail this task, the tree will begin to rot.

The water from the well is magical, and it is so sacred that everything it touches, besides Yggdrasil, becomes as white as the membrane inside of an eggshell. It is from this well that swans originate. It is also at this spot that the gods and goddesses have their daily meetings, and where they cast judgment.
