*Translation: Warm Breeze

A tropical island with clear blue beaches and lavender sands, a place warm year round with mild winters. There's heavy vegetation, lush jungles with clearings where small settlements can be found, and larger maritime villages on the shores of its beaches. 

Varmvindr is the home of the Tabaxi, and is a well kept secret known by few outside of their race. There are plenty of rumours about the Tabaxi homeland, but typically, only their trading partners know of its location, and those that do are sworn to secrecy, handpicked as the trustworthiest of the bunch.

Piracy is an issue, as many a young Tabaxi finds themselves joining a crew of navel villains, though it's not necessarily a wicked endeavor. Tabaxi pirates are more mischevious than truly evil, preferring acts of theft to acts of slaughter, though their system of what is valuable is hard to understand from an outsider's perspective, as they value the story behind an item more than its material worth. Those who find the pirate's life is not for them may also venture into privateering instead, if they wish to go seafaring.

Tabaxi don't typically name their settlements, but the largest town on the island, a trading hub on the shore, is referred to simply as the Port.
