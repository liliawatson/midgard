*Translation: The Fountain Spring*

Peaceful hot springs, quietly babbling brooks, perfectly clear lakes, and the crown jewel of the nation: its capital city and the beautiful ring of cliffs from which waterfalls pour downwards into a freshwater spring below. Travellers passing through Keldavegr are never without clean water to drink, as the nation prides itself on keeping its rivers clear enough to see the smooth pebbles that cover the riverbed. Industry has yet to arrive in this smaller nation, and many of its people make their living with small, well irrigated farms. Fishing is a common hobby for most citizens here, as the lakes are plentiful, and it passes the time in the idyllic countryside. 

The most common races are elves, humans, harengon, halflings, and gnomes. 

### Capital: Bjarghringr (ᛒᛃᚨᚱᚷᚺᚱᛁᚾᚷᚱ)

*Translation: Ring of Cliffs*

The roar of massive waterfalls cascading down the side of Bjarghringr’s cliffside are often drowned out by the sounds of the castle city. Festivals are carried out here year round, and even without a holiday, the colorful decor of the capital and the music on every street corner makes this peaceful city a sight to behold. Within the castle itself rule Queen Ergella and Queen Idril, a pair of elven sisters as old as the city itself. Their beauty makes even that of Bjarghringr seem mundane, and though Keldavegr is a nation of peace, sometimes a strange edge to their melodious voices hints at a long forgotten past.
