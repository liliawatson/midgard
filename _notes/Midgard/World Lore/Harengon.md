Harengons were once Light Elves of [[Alfheim]]. A young elf named Frami received a blessing from [[Freya]] after sharing water from her well with the goddess's cats. When asked what she wanted, Frami asked for the reflexes and speed of a rabbit, and Freya granted her with that and more, giving her the features of a rabbit as well. Though, at first, Frami believed Freya's blessing to be a curse in disguise, she soon learned that Freya's blessing had also granted her unnatural luck, as she found herself avoiding danger at every turn on her travels. 

Harengons are bipedal, with the characteristic long feet of the rabbits they resemble and fur in a variety of colors. They share the keen senses and powerful legs of leporine creatures and are full of energy, like a wound-up spring. Harengons still carry Freya's blessing, and they often find themselves a few fortunate feet away from dangers during adventures.
