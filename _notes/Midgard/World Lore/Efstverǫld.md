*Translation: The Highest World*

Towering above the rest of the Floating Continent is Efstverǫld, a mountainous region whose peaks kiss the sky. This is the most populated of the countries on this island, with several large cities of industrious nature. Magic powers the technology that is developed here, and many inventors and artificers are drawn to make the journey here to improve their craft. Some of the best of the best study under the masters of Efstverǫld, before spreading out into the rest of Midgard to use their knowledge for good or evil. Its cities are often built into moutainsides, becoming one with the stone and working with the geography rather than against it. 

The most common races are air genasi, kenku, dwarves, and (formerly) dragonborn.

Capital: Hatignæfa (ᚺᚨᛏᛁᚷᚾᚨᚠᚨ)
*Translation: Tower of the Moon-Eater*

A massive clock tower, with gears and spinning hands, stands at the top of Mount Hati, across the way from Mount Skoll. The twin mountains, named after the twin wolves, sandwich in the town of Hatignæfa, a city full of gruff artisans all squirrelled away in elaborate hideyholes working on their next great invention. Hatignæfa is powered by a mixture of magic and steam, but no one knows where the clock tower gets its power source from. It ticks away, day after day, all by itself with no keeper... many say it's actually a timer, but what it's counting down to, no one knows.
