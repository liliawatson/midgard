The Eternal Ash Tree is called Yggdrasil. It stands in the middle of the world, with branches that stretch out over all of the nine realms. Each realm hangs on its own branch, but if the tree should shake or fall, so will all the realms. 

Odin once sacrificed himself on the tree, using it as a gallows, in order to gain more knowledge, and in the final moments before he  fell from Yggdrasil, he learned the secrets of the runes.

Ratatoskr, the squirrel, scurries up and down the trunk of Yggdrasil, carrying insults to and from Nidhogg, in the Realm of the Dead, and the eagle, who perches in the upper branches of the tree. 

It has three roots, each next to a small body of water; the [[Well of Urd]], the [[Fountain of Mimir]], and the [[Spring of Hvergelmir]].
