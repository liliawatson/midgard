*Translation: The Floating Land*

Fljótabiǫð has a rocky and uneven terrain; there are stones of many different shapes and sizees hovering at varying heights every few feet. Some are smooth and flat, like stepping stones leading to unknown heights, while others are larger and misshapen. Pebbles collect in swarms that have to be waded through like mists. Flowers and weeds spring out of cracks in the ground, grass and moss both clinging to the stone surfaces. Though, just as there are strange elevations, the inverse is true as well, as massive cave structures can be found just below the surface of Fljótabiǫð.

The most common races are earth genasi, goliaths, halflings, and lizardfolk. 

Capital: Fróðleikrsker (ᚠᚱᛟᛏᚺᛚᛖᛁᚴᚱᛋᚴᛖᚱ)
*Translation: Crystal by the Sea*

This is the largest port on the Floating Continent, and the most well known city on the island. Most visitors who come here are travelling for business, but many who seek the Floating Continent's knowledge and magic land here first before embarking on their journeys. Because of this, Fróðleikrsker is a bustling city that never sleeps. However, its buildings are rarely more than two stories tall, due to winds blowing in floating stones that would pose a danger to high infrastructures.
