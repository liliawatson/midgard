The third root of the [[Eternal Ash Tree]] is in [[Niflheim]] of the Realm of the Dead, next to the Spring of Hvergelmir. [[Nidhogg]] the great dragon gnaws on this root constantly, and countless snakes also bite at the treeâ€™s shoots. The dragon will only stop his attempts to destroy Yggdrasil at the hellhound's howl when [[Ragnarok]] comes. 

At this moment, Nidhogg will spread his wings, and fly to the entrance of the gates of [[Helheim]], where he will join [[Hel]]'s army to march on the Mortal Realm.
